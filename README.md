Hello, I am **Akshara Debnath** I am a beginner to coding and website development!!

This was website purely developed for a company I worked for, however since they decided no to host
my work, I hosted it myself. This is purely all my hardwork on site, used to develop a site helping
people feel better. This is my version of it and I am continously releasing new versions/ updates.
Please check it out and join our server on discord!!
